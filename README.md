## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use `<picture>` to change image `src` value depending on screen size

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(width: 375px)" srcset="mobile-img.png" />
  <source media="(min-width: 376px)" srcset="desktop-img.png" />
  <img src="optimal-img.png" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I would like to learn to make my webpages more accessible.

### Useful resources

While working on this project, I didn't quite consult a ton of resources, I just relied on previous knowledge and put my thoughts on paper before writing the code. and each time i got stuck, I would step back and come back at a later time with a fresh and new way of tackling the challenge.

By writing down my thoughts and thinking through what I wanted to do, I was figure thngs out, maybe not in the best way possible, but i did write the code and it ran :astonished:.
